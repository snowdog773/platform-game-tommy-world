# platform-game-tommy-world

This is my first go at creating a "proper" game and will be using this the readme file of my repository to document my journey, and keep a record of the challenges I faced and hopefully my successes. I am a junior developer who completed a full stack boot camp in May 2022, and at the time of writing I'm working as a teaching assistant for said boot camp helping the next wave of new developers navigate their way through the world of tech, while seeking a full time developer position.

My plan for the game is it will be a side scrolling shooter, where the character is controlled using WASD and the mouse pointer is used to control aiming. I already forsee a multitude of technical challenges to overcome and anticipate there will be a number of challenges I'm not expecting.

The tech I am planning to use is React because I feel the component structure lends itself well to a project like this. There is going to be a lot of data flying around as well so I will be bringing in Redux to handle the state management.

Please feel free to fork this repo or send PRs, there is a lot of work here and I am totally up for collaborators to get involved, and people of The Jump - cohort 9 in particular.

Thanks for taking an interest in my work

Set up the project. Set up a game window and a simple block sprite which moves around the screen with WASD event listeners. Currently more than about 2 key presses per second crashes the browser, so obviously doing something very wrong thus far.
